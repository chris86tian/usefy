   ```bash
   npm install -g serverless
   ```
2. Deploy the service:
   ```bash
   serverless deploy
   ```
3. The deployment will provide an API Gateway URL, e.g.:

   ```
   Service deployed to stack growthhungry-service-dev (60s)

   endpoints:
     ANY - https://khbciw4vke.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/
     ANY - https://khbciw4vke.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/{proxy+}

## OAuth Configuration

To enable Google OAuth, configure the following settings in the Google Cloud Console :

### **Authorized JavaScript Origins (Frontend)**

- âœ… `https://usefy.com`
- âœ… `http://localhost:3000`

### **Authorized Redirect URIs (Backend)**

- âœ… `https://khbciw4vke.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/auth/google/callback`
- âœ… `http://localhost:8001/auth/google/callback`

Ensure that your backend has an `/auth/google/callback` route to handle authentication responses.
